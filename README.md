Maze Solver (Java)
📌 Overview

This project is a Maze Solver implemented in Java using backtracking.
It takes a maze as input (2D grid) and finds a path from the start point to the destination if one exists.

⚙️ Features

Solves a maze using backtracking.

Handles different maze sizes.

Detects if no solution exists.

Easy to extend for GUI or visualization.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (Core Java, Backtracking, 2D Arrays)

▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository:
 https://github.com/KarwanKamboj/Maze_Solver

Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or compile with javac:
