Maze Solver (Java)
📌 Overview
This project is a Maze Solver implemented in Java using backtracking.
It takes a maze as input (2D grid) and finds a path from the start point to the destination if one exists.

⚙️ Features
Solves a maze using backtracking.
Handles different maze sizes.
Detects if no solution exists.
Easy to extend for GUI or visualization.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (Core Java, Backtracking, 2D Arrays)
